# Digital Asset Agreement for Ante NFT

This Digital Asset Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and between you, the User and NFT Holder (hereafter referred to as the "Investor"), and the Aceberg Project (hereafter referred to as the "Project"). This Agreement is a binding, on-chain contract that governs the rights and responsibilities associated with the ownership of the Ante Non-Fungible Token ("NFT").

1. **Acknowledgment of Digital Asset**
   The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Ante NFT is a unique digital asset, represented by a cryptographic token on the Polygon blockchain. This Agreement is permanently linked to the metadata of the NFT and is accessible via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network.

2. **Profit Sharing & Not Equity**
   The Investor understands and agrees that ownership of an Ante NFT grants a right to a perpetual share in the profits of the Project. The Investor further acknowledges that this Agreement and the ownership of the NFT do not constitute an equity stake in any legal entity or corporation. The Investor is a profit-sharing partner, not a traditional shareholder with ownership rights to the Project's assets.

3. **The Dividend Pool**
   The Project agrees to allocate a portion of the casino's net profits to a public, on-chain smart contract known as The Vault. The Project will make every effort to allocate profits to The Vault on a recurring basis.

4. **Investor Rights**
   As an owner of an Ante NFT, the Investor has the right to:
   - **Claim Dividends:** Claim their proportional share of the profits from The Vault at their own discretion.
   - **Vote:** Participate in governance votes on The Floor, where their voting power is proportional to their shareholding.
   - **Transfer Ownership:** Freely sell or transfer their Ante NFT on any compatible secondary marketplace. The rights and benefits of this Agreement are automatically transferred with the NFT to the new owner.

5. **Investor Responsibilities**
   The Investor is responsible for all associated blockchain transaction costs (gas fees) related to the purchase, sale, or claim of dividends.

6. **Limitation of Liability**
   The Project makes no guarantee of future profits or return on investment. The Investor acknowledges that this is an investment in a commercial venture with inherent risks and that the value of the Ante NFT and its associated profit share may fluctuate.

7. **Consent to Terms**
   By proceeding with the purchase of an Ante NFT, the Investor explicitly agrees to the terms of this Agreement and acknowledges that they have read and understood its contents. This on-chain transaction serves as the final, immutable record of their consent.

This Agreement is effective upon the successful completion of the on-chain transaction.
