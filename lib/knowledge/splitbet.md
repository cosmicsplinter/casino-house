House.inc: A Manifesto for a New Era
This is not a traditional brand guide. This is a declaration of a new reality. We are House.inc, and we are not here to play by the old rules. This manifesto outlines our philosophy, our mission, and our promise to the brave who dare to join us. We are building a new precedent in the most savage business on earth, and we are not afraid to redefine what it means to be a business.
The House is a Unified Collective
The term "The House" has always held a single, cynical truth: the house always wins. In the old world, the house was a faceless corporation designed to extract value. We are here to shatter that paradigm.
At House.inc, The House is a unified collective. It is comprised of every Staker who holds a direct stake in the business. This is a network of co-owners built on a foundation of radical transparency and shared ownership, where every member's success is tied to the collective's. It is more than a brand; it is a formidable network.
Our Philosophy: Breaking the Rules, Not the Bank
The gambling industry is built on a lack of trust. The players are the outsiders, and the house is the enemy. We are ending that war. We are not here to just win; we are here to change the game forever.
Trust is a Weapon: Our greatest asset is not our technology; it's our radical transparency. We believe trust should be a verifiable fact, not a promise you have to blindly accept. Our entire financial system is a public ledger, a permanent record that cannot be altered. We give you the tools to audit us, to verify us, to trust us.
The Owner's Edge: In the old world, the house had an edge. In our world, the Stakers are the house, and our edge is our unity. We are a collective of co-owners with a shared vision. We do not just bet on the outcome; we own the house, and its success is our success.
A New Breed of Capital: This is not a traditional investment. The Ante NFT is not an equity stake in a paper company. It is a perpetual claim on the profit, a direct tie to the revenue flow. We are creating a new class of digital assets, and we are not asking for your permission.
Our Mission: Building a Legacy, Not a Fortune
We are not just building a casino; we are building a legacy. Our roadmap is a meticulously planned execution of this vision, designed to turn a single idea into a global precedent. Our goal is to build a self-sustaining ecosystem that generates long-term value for our Stakers.
This is for the ambitious, the rebels, and the brave. This is for the ones who are ready to stop being players and start being the owners. This is your chance to stop running in the rat race and start building a new house, for our family.



NFT-Based Investment System
A Framework for Trustless Profit Sharing
1. The Core Principle: Trustless & Verifiable
The House.inc ecosystem is built on a fundamental principle: our investors should not be forced to trust a centralized company. Instead, all critical financial actions—from ownership to profit distribution—are anchored on public, immutable smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain. This approach ensures every transaction is verifiable by anyone, at any time, on a public ledger.
2. The NFT: Your Digital Share
Technology: We will use the ERC-1155 smart contract standard on the Polygon (Matic) blockchain.
Purpose: Each ERC-1155 NFT represents one "share" in the business. When an investor purchases an NFT, they acquire a verifiable, non-fungible token that permanently records their ownership on the blockchain. This NFT is the source of all shareholder rights, including the right to claim dividends.
Why it's better: The ERC-1155 standard is a highly efficient choice, allowing for significantly lower gas fees for investors when they mint or trade their shares. This makes the investment more accessible and liquid.
3. NFT Minting: The On-Demand Approach
To ensure the integrity of our decentralized system, NFTs will be minted and transferred to the investor's wallet in a single, atomic transaction immediately after a successful purchase. This is the only way to maintain a trustless and transparent process.
How it Works:
Investment Initiated: An investor connects their wallet and initiates a transaction to purchase a specific number of shares.
Smart Contract Execution: Our smart contract's mint() function receives the payment from the investor's wallet.
Automatic Minting and Transfer: In the same instant, the contract mints a new NFT (or NFTs) and transfers it directly to the investor's wallet address.
Immutability: This entire process is recorded as a single, verifiable event on the blockchain. If the payment fails for any reason, the NFT is never created, and no funds are transferred.
This method eliminates any risk of a central authority losing or mismanaging investor records and ensures that NFT ownership is always accurately reflected on the blockchain.
4. The Smart Contract: The Core of the Business
Technology: A smart contract written in Solidity and deployed on the Polygon blockchain.
Purpose: This contract is the engine of our business. It is a self-executing agreement that automatically handles the rules of our investment platform.
Key Functions:
Minting: Allows investors to buy NFTs (shares) directly from the contract.
Profit Deposit: A function that the project owners can call to deposit a portion of the casino's profits into a central, secure dividend pool.
Dividend Claim: A function that any investor can call at any time to claim their share of the profit. The smart contract automatically knows how many NFTs are in their wallet and calculates their exact payout.
5. Wallets: Your Investor's Identity
Technology: MetaMask and other EVM-compatible wallets.
Purpose: The investor's wallet address is their identity on the blockchain. The smart contract does not rely on personal information like name or email.
How it works: When an investor connects their wallet to our dashboard, the smart contract simply reads the wallet address and instantly knows how many NFTs (shares) they own, allowing it to accurately calculate and distribute their dividend. This makes the entire system permissionless and truly decentralized.
6. The Profit Distribution Model
The entire profit distribution model is designed for maximum transparency and efficiency.
Profit Generation: The House.inc Casino, as a crypto casino, generates all its revenue and profit in cryptocurrency.
Profit Standardization: To protect investors from market volatility, all casino profits are converted into USDC (USD Coin), a stablecoin backed by fully transparent, audited reserves. We chose USDC to build long-term trust and provide a predictable value for all dividends.
Transparent Profit Reporting: At the end of each profit period, the accumulated profits are officially transferred from the casino's Treasury to a dedicated Dividend Pool smart contract. This transaction is a public, permanent record on the blockchain, verifiable by all.
On-Demand Payouts: Investors can claim their dividends at any time by calling the smart contract's “Claim Dividend” function. The contract automatically calculates their payout based on their share count and distributes the USDC directly to their wallet.
7. The Secondary Market: Unlocking Liquidity
The NFT shares are designed to be fully transferable, enabling a liquid secondary market that simplifies our business operations and benefits investors.
Investor Liquidity: The ability to sell their shares on platforms like OpenSea provides investors with an easy exit strategy, making the investment more appealing.
Automatic Ownership Transfer: When an NFT share is sold, the blockchain immutably records the new owner's wallet. Our smart contract instantly recognizes the change, automatically assigning all future dividends to the new owner.
Operational Simplicity: This system means we do not need to build or maintain a complex backend for tracking ownership. The smart contract handles all transfers, freeing our team to focus on growing the core business.
8. Data Transparency: Powering the Dashboard
Technology: The Graph
Purpose: To make all blockchain data readable and accessible for our dashboard.
How it works: Our dashboard fetches all financial data—total profit, current dividend pool balance, and an investor's share count—directly from the smart contracts via a decentralized indexing protocol called The Graph. This ensures the dashboard is always a reflection of the single source of truth on the blockchain.
9. Assurance of Trust & Security: The Smart Contract Audit
The integrity of this entire system hinges on the security of our smart contracts. For this reason, a comprehensive smart contract audit from a reputable, third-party firm is a non-negotiable step in our development roadmap.
Security First: An independent audit by a leading firm (e.g., CertiK, Halborn) will be conducted to thoroughly test for vulnerabilities and ensure the code is bug-free.
Public Verification: The full audit report will be published in our Docs & Legal section, providing a public, verifiable record of our commitment to security.
Key Takeaways: Investor FAQ
How is my ownership and dividend payout verified? Your ownership is verified by the number of Ante NFTs you hold in your wallet. The smart contract reads this information directly from the blockchain to automatically and transparently calculate your exact dividend payout.
Is my investment protected from cryptocurrency volatility? Yes. All casino profits are converted into USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This ensures that the value of your dividend payouts remains stable and predictable.
What is the role of the smart contract in this system? The smart contract is the single source of truth. It is a self-executing agreement that automatically handles everything from minting NFTs and calculating dividends to distributing profits. It eliminates the need to trust a centralized company.
Can I sell my NFT shares? Yes. Your NFT shares are fully transferable on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea. The dividend rights are tied to the NFT itself, so the new owner automatically inherits all future benefits.
What is being done to ensure the security of the platform? A comprehensive smart contract audit from a reputable, third-party firm is a non-negotiable step in our development roadmap. The full audit report will be made public for a verifiable record of our commitment to security.




House.inc Digital Asset Agreement
Terms of Service for Your Digital Investment
1. The Digital Asset Agreement: A Foundation of Trust
Purpose: The Digital Asset Agreement serves as a public-facing document that outlines the terms of the NFT purchase, including the rights of the investor (e.g., perpetual profit sharing) and the non-equity nature of the investment.
The Flow: Before an investor can complete a purchase, they must first review and digitally acknowledge their agreement to these terms. This process ensures that every investor is fully informed and aware of their rights and responsibilities.
2. Immutable & Decentralized Storage
To uphold our commitment to transparency, the agreement is not stored on a centralized server. Instead, it is permanently and immutably recorded using decentralized technology.
Technology: We utilize the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data.
The Process: The final, signed version of the Digital Asset Agreement is uploaded to IPFS. This generates a unique, permanent hash (a cryptographic fingerprint of the file).
The NFT Link: This IPFS hash is then permanently embedded within the metadata of every NFT share. This creates a direct, unbreakable link between the investor's asset and the terms of their investment.
3. Transferability & Perpetual Access
A core feature of our trustless model is that every NFT holder, regardless of how they acquired the asset, has full access to this document.
No Additional Steps: When an NFT share is transferred to a new owner (e.g., through a sale on a secondary marketplace), no additional steps are required to transfer the agreement.
Seamless Access: The new owner can simply view the NFT's metadata to retrieve the IPFS hash, which allows them to access the original, immutable document at any time.
This ensures that the terms of the investment are transparent and available to every single person who holds the NFT, making it a true, self-contained digital asset.
Key Takeaways - Digital Asset Agreement
What is the Digital Asset Agreement? It is a public-facing document that outlines the terms of the NFT purchase, including the investor's rights to perpetual profit sharing and the non-equity nature of their investment.
Where is the agreement stored? The document is stored permanently and immutably on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized network.
Is the agreement tied to my NFT? Yes. A unique, permanent hash of the document is embedded within the metadata of every NFT share. This creates a direct and unbreakable link between your asset and the terms of your investment.
What happens to the agreement if I sell my NFT? The new owner of your NFT will automatically have access to the agreement. The document is permanently linked to the token itself, so it transfers with the ownership.
What is the purpose of this agreement? The agreement ensures that every investor is fully aware of their rights and the business model, providing a foundation of trust and transparency for the entire ecosystem.



Ecosystem - A Definitive Glossary
A Definitive Glossary of Key Terms


Stakers
Community Members – The Investors of the House
"Stakers" is the official name for all investors who are part of the House.inc community. It is a modern, on-brand term that directly ties into the core action of the project: staking a claim in the business. This name strengthens the community's identity, creating a sense of shared purpose and collective ownership.
Ante
Ownership NFTs – Your Seat at the Table
Ante NFTs represent fractional ownership in the casino’s profit-sharing system. By acquiring Ante, Stakers become more than just participants — they become true stakeholders. Each Ante acts as a permanent receipt of investment, tying the holder directly to the revenue flow of the platform. This system mirrors the poker buy-in — symbolic of joining the real game. Ante holders receive voting power, exclusive perks, and recurring profit distributions through the Vault.
Chips ($CHIP)
Utility Token – The Currency of the House
$CHIP is the native utility token that powers the entire casino ecosystem. Used for gameplay, purchases, bonuses, and in-platform exchanges, Chips replicate the feel of casino chips but with the security and fluidity of the blockchain. They can be earned through play, distributed to exclusive members, or traded on DEXs if liquidity is enabled. This asset bridges both value and utility within the system, forming the core transactional layer of the platform.
Edge
Points System – Gamified Loyalty & Rewards
Edge is the casino’s internal reward and loyalty system, designed to drive user retention. It is earned through engagement, completing missions, referrals, and staking. Players accumulate Edge to unlock exclusive perks like cashback, VIP event access, loot boxes, and custom in-game experiences. Think of it as your XP bar in the casino world. Unlike Chips, Edge is non-transferable and built solely to reward long-term commitment and elevate a user's status.
The Floor
Governance – Where Shareholders Vote
The Floor is the DAO-style governance hub where Ante holders cast votes on platform decisions. These decisions can range from game updates and feature rollouts to treasury allocations and partner integrations. A Staker's number of votes is proportional to their shareholding, giving high-tier members (like Executives and Chairman) more influence. The Floor ensures democratic alignment between the casino and its community owners, transforming spectators into true co-decision-makers.
Vault
Treasury – Where Profits Are Collected & Split
The Vault is the digital reserve where all casino profits are pooled. At the end of each revenue cycle, a portion of the net profit flows into the Vault and is distributed to Ante holders based on their percentage of ownership. Think of it as the casino’s profit pot. Transparent, smart contract-driven, and fully auditable, the Vault turns speculative gambling into a source of long-term yield for committed backers.
The Pit Boss
AI Assistant – The All-Knowing Guide
The Pit Boss is the AI-powered assistant designed to be the all-knowing guide for every Staker. Unlike a standard chatbot, The Pit Boss has real-time access to all on-chain business data, including casino performance, investor stats, and individual portfolio details. Its role is to provide concise, data-driven answers to any questions related to the business. The Pit Boss serves as a source of trusted, authoritative information, reinforcing the brand's commitment to transparency and empowering investors with a bird's-eye view of the entire ecosystem.

The Token's Purpose
Utility, Not Speculation

The House.inc token, $CHIP, is the native utility token of our ecosystem. It is a tool for interaction, not a primary investment vehicle. Its purpose is distinct and separate from the NFT shares.
Casino Currency: $CHIP is the core currency used for all gameplay, wagers, and transactions within the casino. It provides a simple, consistent, and on-brand experience for all players.
Fuel for the Ecosystem: $CHIP can be used to unlock exclusive features, participate in special events, or receive in-game bonuses, providing it with tangible utility beyond basic gameplay.
Decentralized Liquidity: $CHIP will be paired with a stablecoin (USDC) in a decentralized liquidity pool on the Polygon network. This allows for seamless, on-demand swaps, giving players an easy way to enter and exit the ecosystem.
Tokenomics & Distribution Schedule
The total supply of $CHIP tokens is finite and fixed at 10,000,000 tokens. The distribution is designed for fairness and long-term sustainability.
Liquidity Pool: 10% (1,000,000 $CHIP) will be allocated for initial liquidity on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). This ensures a fair market price from day one.
Community & Rewards: 45% (4,500,000 $CHIP) is reserved for a community treasury. These tokens will be distributed over time to reward player loyalty, incentivize referrals, and power future staking and airdrop programs.
Ecosystem Treasury: 20% (2,000,000 $CHIP) is allocated for the long-term growth of the project, including development, strategic partnerships, and new feature integrations.
Team & Advisors: 15% (1,500,000 $CHIP) is allocated to the founding team and advisors. These tokens will be subject to a strict vesting schedule of 3-4 years to ensure a long-term commitment to the project's success.
Marketing & Operations: 10% (1,000,000 $CHIP) is allocated for marketing campaigns, user acquisition, and operational expenses.
Launching the Token: The Fair Launch Model
Our token will be launched using a transparent and community-friendly Fair Launch Model. We will not set the price, nor will we conduct a private pre-sale.
Initial Price Discovery: The price of $CHIP will be determined by the market. We will seed a DEX liquidity pool with a fixed ratio of $CHIP and USDC, and the market will dictate the price based on supply and demand.
Preventing a "Rug Pull": To build immediate trust, we will implement a Liquidity Provider (LP) Lockup. The initial LP tokens from the launch will be locked in a smart contract for a predetermined period (e.g., 3-5 years). This ensures that the initial liquidity cannot be withdrawn by the project owners, providing a critical security assurance to the community.
Security & Audits: A Foundation of Trust
The security of our token is non-negotiable. We have implemented a multi-layered security plan to ensure the integrity of the $CHIP smart contract.
Third-Party Audit: The $CHIP smart contract will undergo a full, independent security audit by a reputable third-party firm. The audit report will be made public in its entirety on our Docs & Legal page.
Immutable Contract: The token's smart contract will be non-upgradeable and immutable, meaning its rules and token supply cannot be changed by the project owners after launch.

Community Hubs: Launch the Private Lounge chat feature and upgrade the Pit Boss AI to a Beta version with an expanded knowledge base, ready for community engagement.
Vault Activation: The Vault will be a live, on-chain entity, but its profit distribution function will be activated after the casino launch.
Phase 3: The Casino Launch & The Growth Engine
Objective: To launch the core revenue-generating product and use the momentum of our community to drive adoption.
This is where the vision becomes reality. We will launch the core casino platform, proving that our on-chain profit model can function at scale. This phase is about transitioning from a promise to a profitable, operational business, with every Staker (Investor) benefiting from its success.
The Casino Platform: Launch the casino with a selection of provably fair games. The entire financial engine of the casino will be powered by smart contracts, using the $CHIP token as currency and routing profits to the on-chain Treasury.
Verifiable Profit Model: The Vault is now active and receiving profits. We will demonstrate how profits are transparently funneled and how Stakers (Investors) can claim their dividends on-demand, proving the trustless model in action.
The Final Pit Boss: The Pit Boss AI is now fully integrated with real-time casino analytics, providing a comprehensive, all-knowing guide for Stakers (Investors).
Phase 4: Mobile Application Launch
Objective: To expand the project's reach and provide a seamless mobile experience for Stakers (Investors).
This phase is dedicated to expanding our presence beyond the web. We will launch a mobile companion app that serves as a powerful, non-gambling utility, ensuring our Stakers (Investors) can monitor their portfolio and engage with the community on the go.
Investor Companion App: Develop and launch a mobile application for both iOS and Android.
Core Functionality: The app will be a "de-gamblified" product, focusing exclusively on investor-facing features, such as portfolio monitoring, dividend tracking, and access to community hubs like the Private Lounge and the Pit Boss AI.
Phase 5: The Strategic Pivot: The Flagship Product
Objective: To develop a unique, high-energy casino game that becomes a brand synonym, driving viral growth and massive player acquisition.
This is our strategic pivot toward market domination. We will not build a generic game library; we will build one killer application designed for virality. This flagship game will be our ultimate marketing tool, turning the project into a household name in the crypto space.
Game Development: Dedicate resources to building a single, breakthrough game—similar to what Spribe achieved with 'Aviator'—that can dominate a market segment.
Launch & Promotion: Launch the flagship game with a dedicated marketing campaign. The goal is to make it the most played game in the crypto space, turning it into a powerful engine for player acquisition and revenue.
